# hello_world_laravel
My first milestone in learning Laravel
I created Hello World in Laravel using wampserver tool with Composer that integrated into PHP8.

1. Update web.php in wamp64\www\mylaravelproject\routes folder.
2. Add HelloWorldController.php into wamp64\www\mylaravelproject\app\Http\Controllers folder.
3. Add hello.blade.php file into wamp64\www\mylaravelproject\app\Http\Controllers folder.
4. Open Wampserver to ensure your server running.
5. Open your command prompt from Windows and type "cd Disk:\wamp64\www\your_project_name" and enter.
6. Type "php artisan serve" and enter.
7. Try to run using localhost:8080/hello or  http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello
